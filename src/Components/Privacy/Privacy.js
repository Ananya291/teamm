                                        The Company uses data collection devices such as “cookies” on certain pages of the
                                        website to help analyse our web page
                                        flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. “Cookies” are
                                        small data files placed on your
                                        hard drive or device that assist us in providing our services and may include an
                                        anonymous unique identifier. The
                                        Company offers certain features that are only available through the use of a “cookie”.

                                        The Company also uses cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during
                                        a session. Cookies can also
                                        help the Company provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies
                                        are “session cookies,” meaning
                                        that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You
                                        are always free to decline our
                                        cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use
                                        certain features on the website and
                                        you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.

                                        Additionally, you may encounter “cookies” or other similar files on certain pages of the
                                        website that are placed by
                                        third parties. The Company does not control the use of cookies by third parties.

                                        If you send the Company personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other
                                        users or third parties send us
                                        correspondence about your activities on the website, the Company may collect such
                                        information into a file specific to

                                        The Company does not retain any information collected for any longer than is reasonably
                                        considered necessary by us, or
                                        such period as may be required by applicable laws. The Company may be required to
                                        disclose any information that is
                                        lawfully sought from it by a judicial or other competent body pursuant to applicable
